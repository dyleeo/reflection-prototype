                With a better conceptual understanding of light rays and how reflections bounce off surfaces at equal angles, I would go back and refactor my function so that the ray calculations would be able to bounce and calculate recursively. I spent a healthy portion of my time demonstrating reflections and virtual rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I had more time, I would also have liked to break down the codebase into more granular components for scalability and maintainability.

        <div class="question">
            <h3>How could your interactive be extended to cover more concepts in optics?</h3>
            <p>   
                I leveraged 2D and 3D environments to create the experiment but had to work briskly to finish the project in time. With more time, I would have liked to create a mini toolset and a modular environment that could swap concept scenarios, get more in-depth with the illustrations, and have articulated animations with energy and style.

        <div class="question">
            <h3>What parts of your interactive could be useful in other areas of STEM? Give a few examples.</h3>
            <p>   
                This interactive could be repurposed to teach math concepts. There were a few instances where trigonometry was leveraged to calculate angles based on the delta of two points. Using arc tangent, we could derive the angle between two points and also draw circular patterns using sin and cos functions.Â 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were some calculations to convert radians to degrees and vice versa, which could teach basic algebraic math.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 3D interactive could be modified and used to teach the laws of physics and gravitational forces in a fun and gamified manner.
